Find here some working examples.

.. tip:: Read the section on :ref:`Working with keys and values` to better understand
    the differences between working with Collection compared to normal PHP arrays.
    The same principles apply to all :ref:`API methods <Methods (operations)>`,
    giving you great power to manipulate various types of data if used correctly.

Working with keys and values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example shows the power of a lazy library and highlight also how to use
it in the wrong way.

Unlike regular PHP arrays where there can only be one key of type int or
string, a lazy library can have multiple times the same keys and they can
be of any type!

.. code-block:: php

    // This following example is perfectly valid, despite that having array for keys
    // in a regular PHP arrays is impossible.
    $input = static function () {
        yield ['a'] => 'a';
        yield ['b'] => 'b';
        yield ['c'] => 'c';
    };
    Collection::fromIterable($input());

A lazy collection library can also have multiple times the same key.

Here we are going to make a frequency analysis on the text and see the
result. We can see that some data is missing, why?

.. code-block:: php

    $string = 'aaaaabbbbcccddddeeeee';

    $collection = Collection::fromString($string)
        // Run the frequency analysis tool.
        ->frequency()
        // Convert to regular array.
        ->all(); // [5 => 'e', 4 => 'd', 3 => 'c']

The reason that the frequency analysis for letters 'a' and 'b' is missing
is because when you call the method ``Collection::all()``, the collection converts
the lazy collection into a regular PHP array, and PHP doesn't allow having
multiple time the same key, so it overrides the previous data and there will be
missing information in the resulting array.

In order to circumvent this, you can either ``wrap`` the final result or
``normalize`` it.
A better way would be to not convert this into an array and use the lazy
collection as an iterator.

Wrapping the result will wrap each result into a PHP array.
Normalizing the result will replace keys with a numerical index, but then
you might lose some information then.

It's up to you to decide which one you want to use.
