PHP Collection
==============

Collection is a functional utility library for PHP greater than 7.4, including
8.0.

It's similar to `other available collection libraries`_ based on regular PHP
arrays, but with a lazy mechanism under the hood that strives to do as little
work as possible while being as flexible as possible.

Functions like `array_map()`_, `array_filter()`_ and `array_reduce()`_ are
great, but they create new arrays and everything is eagerly done before going to
the next step. Lazy collection leverages PHP's generators, iterators, and yield
statements to allow you to work with very large data sets while keeping memory
usage as low as possible.

For example, imagine your application needs to process a multi-gigabyte log file
while taking advantage of this library's methods to parse the logs.
Instead of reading the entire file into memory at once, this library may be used
to keep only a small part of the file in memory at a given time.

On top of this, this library:

 * is `immutable`_,
 * is extendable,
 * leverages the power of PHP `generators`_ and `iterators`_,
 * uses `S.O.L.I.D. principles`_,
 * extensively tested,
 * uses strict types,
 * framework agnostic.

Except for a few methods, most methods are `pure`_ and return a
`new Collection object`_.

Also, unlike regular PHP arrays where keys must be either of type ``int`` or
``string``, this collection library lets you use any kind of type for keys:
``integer``, ``string``, ``object``, ``array``, ... anything! This library could
be a valid replacement for `\SplObjectStorage`_ but with much more features.
This way of working opens up new perspectives and another way of handling data,
in a more functional way.

And last but not least, collection keys are preserved throughout most
operations; while it might lead to some confusion at first, please carefully
read :ref:`this example <Working with keys and values>` for the full explanation
and benefits.

This library has been inspired by:

 * `Laravel Support Package`_
 * `DusanKasan/Knapsack`_
 * `mtdowling/transducers`_
 * `Ruby Array`_
 * `Collect.js`_
 * `nikic/iter`_
 * `Haskell`_
 * `Ramda`_
 * `Lazy.js`_

Features
--------

-  **Decoupled**: Each Collection method is a shortcut to one isolated
   standard class, each operation has its own responsibility. Usually,
   the arguments needed are standard PHP variables like ``int``,
   ``string``, ``callable`` or ``iterator``. It allows users to use
   those operations individually, at their own will, to build up
   something custom. Currently, more than :ref:`100 operations <api>`
   are available in this library. This library is an example of what
   you can do with all those small bricks, but nothing prevents users
   from using an operation on its own as well.

-  **It takes function first, data-last**: In the following example,
   multiple operations are created. The data to be operated on is
   generally supplied at last.

   .. code:: php

      <?php

      $data = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz'];
      $filterCallback = static fn(string $userId): bool => 'foo' !== $userId;

      // Using the Collection library
      $collection = Collection::fromIterable($data)
          ->filter($filterCallback)
          ->reverse();
      print_r($collection->all()); // ['baz', 'bar']

      // Using single operations.
      $filter = Filter::of()($filterCallback);
      $reverse = Reverse::of();
      $pipe = Pipe::of()($reverse, $filter);

      print_r(iterator_to_array($pipe($data)));  // ['baz', 'bar']

   More information about this in the `Brian Lonsdorf's conference`_,
   even if this is for Javascript,
   those concepts are common to other programming languages.

   In a nutshell, the combination of currying and function-first enables
   the developer to compose functions with very little code (*often in a
   “point-free” fashion*), before finally passing in the relevant user
   data.

-  **Operations are stateless and curried by default**: This currying
   makes it easy to compose functions to create new functions. Because
   the API is *function-first*, *data-last*, you can continue composing
   and composing until you build up the function you need before
   dropping in the data. See `this Hugh Jackson article`_ describing
   the advantages of this style.

   In the following example, the well-known `flatMap`_ could
   be composed of other operations as such:

   .. code:: php

      <?php

      $userData = ['foo,bar', 'baz,john'];

      $flatMap = static fn (callable $callable) =>
                     Pipe::of()(
                        Map::of()($callable),
                        Flatten::of()(1),
                        Normalize::of()
                     );

      $callback = fn(string $name): array => explode(',', $name);

      print_r(iterator_to_array($flatMap($callback)($userData))); // ['foo', 'bar', 'baz', 'john']
